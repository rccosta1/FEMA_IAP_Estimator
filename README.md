A Google Colab Notebook to estimate approval rate and amount from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Individuals Assistance Program.

High-level descriptions of the models and how to use them are provided in the Python notebooks in this repository.

Note: a file containing FEMA IAP data for CA is provided in this repository. It is not possible to upload the file containing data for the entire US (too large). The link below will allow you to download the file for the entire US and add it to the folder on your machine. In this case, remember to modify the line of code to read the file below and not the file the repo.
